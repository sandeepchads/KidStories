# Naughty Botty Dida
I am feeling a little sad today.  
Dida was not feeling very well this morning.  
She complained of some discomfort and uneasiness.  

I ran to dad and mom and informed them about Dida.  

Dad, mom, Iva, and I took Dida to show to the doctor.  

I saw that the doctor had a long title under his name.  

He was a CAR - DIO - LO - GIST.  

A cardiologist takes care of our heart.  

The cardiologist checked something on Dida's wrist and put a sticky thing on her shoulder.  

Dad tells me that this is to get a better sense of her heart.  


Doctor said that Dida's heart is beating great  
And her weight is 60kg  
To know a little better  
We need to get an ECG  

The ECG report is my favorite  
It is so colorful and bright  
It has lines that go up and down  
All going from left to right  

The next test is called spirometry  
Dida blew hard in a pipe  
To see how strong are her lungs   

Doctor said,
There is nothing to worry  
Her lungs are very strong  
She is very healthy  
But there is only one thing wrong  

She ate a pizza  
And her tummy is paining  
She needs to walk each day  
Even if it is sunny or raining  


Dida promised me 
Never to eat junk food again  
Since I was not happy to see Dida  
In soooo much pain

But now she is hail and heart
And we are going out for a pizza party
